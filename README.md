# Education Record And Analysis
<h4>In education institutes where relative grading is used & graphical analysis of the record.</h4>

<h3>Programming Language : Python</h3>
<h3>Programming Domain : General Purpose Application</h3>
<h4>Libraries Required : </h4>
<ol>
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html"><li> Tkinter </li></a>
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/openpyxl/"><li> Openpyxl </li></a>
</ol>

<h3>Central Idea :</h3>
<h4>The Project has used Tkinter (GUI), OOP, Openpyxl (Python Spreadsheet module) and contains of FOUR main Parts:</h4>
<ol>
<li>The Student Window (Tkinter GUI): Inputs Students Details. (As much Students as faculty wants to enter => no limit => Window Closes only when faculty want to close it.)</li>
<li>Faculty Window (Tkinter GUI): Inputs Grade Points marks range (lowerlimit). For e.g.,</li>
<ol>
<li>Grade Point = 10 (=> Grade AA) => for Mark range 93-100 => Facultyinputs 93(included).</li>
<li>Grade Point = 9 (=> Grade AB) => for Mark range 87-92 => Faculty inputs 87(included). And so on.</li>
</ol>
<li>The information received from above two windows is now converted into excel Sheet (using Openpyxl) and the Total marks, Grade Points, Grades are automatically generated on basis of Faculty window.</li>
<li>This data generated can be used as course record of all students thatcourse and can be visualised further by faculty (if wanted) in terms as charts or Graphs.</li>
</ol>
